# Data Analysis Movie
In this project, we will analyze the movie data associate with the numbers, such as popularity, revenue, and budget, and features of the movies, such as production companies, keywords, and genres. In particular, we are interested in comparing the relationship between budget and popularity, and budget and revenue as well. Similarly, we analyze which production companies provide more revenue, and which genre is the most popular.
